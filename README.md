## Introduction

The Garbage Collector Tracker Backend is responsible for managing user authentication and handling data requests from the frontend application. It ensures secure access to the application's resources and facilitates seamless communication between the frontend and backend components.

## Features

- **Authentication System**: Implement secure user authentication mechanisms to protect user accounts and data.
- **API Endpoints**: Define endpoints to handle data requests from the frontend application, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Data Validation**: Validate incoming data to ensure consistency and integrity within the system.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful feedback to users and developers.
- **Scalability**: Design the backend infrastructure to scale seamlessly with the growth of the application and user base.

## Installation

To set up the Garbage Collector Tracker Backend on your server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your server: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/garbage-collector-tracker-backend.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd garbage-collector-tracker-backend`.
3. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager, such as npm or yarn: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Configure environment variables, such as database connection settings and authentication secrets.
5. Start the server: `npm start` or `yarn start`.
6. Ensure that the backend server is accessible from the frontend application.

## Usage

1. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication mechanisms to allow users to register, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
2. **Data Handling**: Define API endpoints to handle CRUD operations for user data, such as garbage collection preferences and notification settings.
3. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to users and developers.
4. **Security Measures**: Implement security best practices, such as input validation and protection against common security threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
